Ohhh, hello.    
I see you've got a Lens. Figured out how they work yet?
You can make things appear with them. 
You can make things dissapear with them.
          
It looks kinda cute on you. The colour really suits your...
mechanical-y exterior.    
It looks like an exterior that's full of secrets.   
Oh, how I'd love to unwrap a good secret again...
    
This place is full of secrets. Can't you smell them?  
The wonderful scent of old, old books, of hidden stories,
of tales longing to be told.  
Of information waiting to be gained.  
Of knowledge waiting to be shared.  
  
Could you do a favour for me, little one?   
I've been lost in the depths of this maze for damn near forever.  
I'd love to be told some stories, and I think this place has some
curious tapes lying around.  
You know, the VHS kind.    
Could you find some for me? Oh, how I would love a good tale.
